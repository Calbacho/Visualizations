## 🔎 Contexto

We have a dataset with a collection of accidents from the last 4 years in Madrid. I have visualized these accidents through a heatmap and then created a dashboard so the user can navigate through the different areas within Madrid.

## 🔥 Heatmap

We observe a higher concentration in the inner districts of Madrid and in the cirfumference bounded by the M30.

## 🪟 PowerBI Dashboard

Navigating through our dashboard, I have highlited interesting observations. Such as:

- Fridays and Saturdays concentrate the higher number of accidents, probably due to people travelling or due to accidents linked to nightlife.
- August is the month with fewer accidents as there is less activity in the city, due to people leaving for vacation.
- Considerable drop in accidents in 2020 (covid-19 lockdown)
